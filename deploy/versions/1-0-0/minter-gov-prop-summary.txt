<strong>Summary</strong>
This proposal is for the uploading of DEGA’s Minter contract for use in deploying DEGA’s NFT collections to Injective.

DEGA seeks to deploy a next generation Web3 Game Builder on Injective. DEGA Realms - The Wix for Gaming - is an AI-powered application that allows anyone to design, build and monetize games in minutes. Injective is particularly well suited for in-game transactions thanks to its speed and scalability.

DEGA Realms will ignite a vibrant ecosystem of thousands of games on Injective and accelerate the growth of the NFT in-game economy. DEGA Realms is not a one-time game deployment. It’s a platform that lowers the barrier to entry for non-technical users and allows anyone creative to tell their stories and engage their audience through gaming.

As part of our strategy to reduce friction between creators and blockchain powered games we’re integrating the Injective API to DEGA’s Conversational AI smart glasses which opens the door for mass adoption.

<strong>About DEGA</strong>
At DEGA, we see gaming The Rise of the Gamer Nation as a major effective beachhead for Web3 mass adoption because gamers are digitally native. They understand the value of digital goods. If gaming was a country, it would have the GDP of the United Arab Emirates.

Thanks to the power of our vision DEGA has already organically crossed $14 Million in TVL in our stake pools and we’ve grown a community of over 50k followers across our social media channels.

We’re currently coordinating with the Talis and Dagora NFT marketplaces to make sure that all our product offerings remain compatible across the Injective ecosystem.
