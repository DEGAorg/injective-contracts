<strong>Summary</strong>
This proposal is for the uploading of DEGA’s CW721 Collection smart contract binary for use in deploying DEGA’s NFT collections to Injective.

DEGA seeks to deploy a next generation Web3 Game Builder on Injective. DEGA Realms is an AI-powered application that allows anyone to design, build and monetize games in minutes. Injective is particularly well suited for in-game transactions thanks to its speed and scalability.

The deployment of DEGA Realms will connect Injective to DEGA's growing gaming ecosystem and advance the NFT based in-game economy. DEGA Realms is not a one-time game deployment. It’s a platform that lowers the barrier to entry for non-technical users and allows anyone to engage an audience through gaming.

As part of our strategy to reduce friction between creators and blockchain powered games, we will be integrating the Injective NFT deployment to DEGA’s Conversational AI smart glasses to utilize Injective to power NFT based retail consumer transactions - a part of DEGA's initiative for wider mainstream adoption.

<strong>About DEGA</strong>
At DEGA, we see gaming as a major beachhead for Web3 mass adoption because gamers are digitally native. They understand the value of digital goods. If gaming were a country, it would have the GDP of the United Arab Emirates.

DEGA has already organically crossed $14 Million in TVL in our stake pools and we’ve grown a community of over 50k followers across our social media channels.

We’re currently coordinating with Talis and Dagora NFT marketplace protocols to make sure that all of our product offerings remain compatible across the Injective ecosystem.

With a team of seasoned professionals with experience at Animoca Brands, EA Games, Deloitte, Apple, Yuga Labs, Wells Fargo, IOHK, and many more top tier organizations, DEGA is uniquely positioned to make the mass adoption of Web3 gaming a reality.
